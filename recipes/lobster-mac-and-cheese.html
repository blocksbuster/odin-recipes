            <li>1 clove garlic, minced
            <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>        
            <li>1 pound shredded Gruyere cheese</li>

            <li>1 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>kosher salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons panko bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Reserve 2 cups hot pasta water, then drain macaroni in a colander set in the sink. Rinse with cold water to cool; set aside.</li>
                <li>Pour reserved pasta water into the same pot and add lobster halves, cut-side up. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and steam until lobster meat firms and turns opaque, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove lobster to a tray and cool for a few minutes, then remove lobster meat and cut into bite-sized pieces. Reserve shells.</li>
                <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove onions to a small bowl; set aside.</li>
                <li>Place reserved lobster shells, milk, shallot, peppercorns, and garlic into the same saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Melt remaining 5 tablespoons butter in a separate saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until mixture turns pasty and light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Strain milk mixture through a mesh sieve and slowly pour into flour mixture while whisking. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook and stir until thick and smooth, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Stir Gruy√®re, Cheddar, and Romano cheeses into thickened milk mixture until melted and smooth. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in reserved lobster meat, onions, and macaroni.</li>
                <li>Pour mixture into a 4-quart casserole dish and smooth the top. Sprinkle evenly with panko crumbs.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the top is golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
